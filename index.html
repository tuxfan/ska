        <h1>What is SKA?</h1>

<p>The <em>static kernel analyzer (SKA)</em> combines a static, linear
pipeline simulator (similar to the IBM <em>spu_timing</em> tool)
with architectural heuristics to model in-order
instruction issue and pipeline behavior.  Pipeline simulations take as
input the <em>intermediate representation (IR)</em> from
<em>Low-Level Virtual Machine (LLVM)</em>.
LLVM and LLVM IR are adopted
standards in the HPC community,
allowing SKA to support a wide range of source inputs.  SKA also has
support for the upcoming OpenCL
<em>Standard Portable Intermediate Representation (SPIR)</em>, which is
based on LLVM IR version 3.1.  Support for OpenCL kernel source
input (in the form of SPIR) allows SKA to model a rich variety of
important modern computing architectures, and provides users with a
new paradigm for application optimization and design.</p>

<p>The underlying hardware properties accessed by SKA during pipeline
simulation are user-defined, allowing for both modeling of existing
processors, and experimentation with novel resource provisioning.  Thus,
SKA can be employed either as an analysis tool for code optimization, or
as a co-design tool to aid in the creation of new processor
configurations.</p>

<p>Users can visualize the output of SKA pipeline
simulations with the <em>skaview</em> program.  The novel view representations in skaview give
the user both detailed clock-for-clock execution information, as well as
intuitive <em>slope</em> and <em>graph</em> views for high-level detection of serious data
and structural hazards.</p>
